Using a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images.

After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train the network and test it on a novel images!

Project Instructions
The project is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be completed in sequential order:

0_Dataset.ipynb
1_Preliminaries.ipynb
2_Training.ipynb
3_Inference.ipynb
You can find these notebooks in the Udacity workspace that appears in the concept titled Project: Image Captioning. This workspace provides a Jupyter notebook server directly in browser.
